We ran a workshop at an after school program in a poor neighbourhood where children learn numeracy, art and yoga. We decided to play tug of war with them. First we made the rope, that had to be really strong for 40 children and 5 adults to pull.We focused on the perspectiveÂ of working together to make a change just like it took water, soap, many hands and felting movements to transform raw yarn into a sturdy rope!!
