Krishna, teacher and a beginner knitter, was hesitant to knit along with her colleagues who had some experience. Starting with the basic cast on and knit stitches; unraveling the yarn and starting again several times was challenging. However, we patiently persisted with her and by the end, Krishna was confident and extremely pleased with the few lines she had mastered which motivated her to continue along with her peers. 

We discussed and drew similarities with the teachers about children learning at their own different paces. We donated a big bag of yarn and needles and end of the day the groupÂ took their knitting home with the experience and perspective of all being beginners.
